This is the repo of a small project call feature based projector !

The streamlit app will allows you to visualize your time series one by one and some statistics on the Local Analysis page but also visualize the whole dataset based on the Hyndman's tsfeatures.

The global visualisation can be usefull for a modeler, the proximity with some added toy datasets
can give you some insights on how to model your time series !

If needed, a docker image of the project is available on Docker Hub:
